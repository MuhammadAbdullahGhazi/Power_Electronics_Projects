Most of everyday devices need an AC supply to work on, that make our life comfortable and luxurious. For the optimum functionality of the device, it is necessary that the supply should be regulated in the statutory limits of voltage variation ±6 % and frequency variation of ±1 % of rated value at consumer terminal. But in our country we are facing deficiency in power generation end to meet supply and demand that actually cause the violation of these limits in distribution voltages at consumer end. There could be many other reasons by which there is a fluctuation in the supply voltage. This change in the supply voltage may cause the device to damage or make it work in an undesired way. Hence the best alternative is to regulate the supply voltage using a voltage stabilizer. 
Mostly stabilization of voltage is done by relay based stabilizers or AVRs using servo mechanism. In both techniques due to the mechanical parts involved in them they are bulky, noisy and have wear and tear with the passage of time. Switching speed of voltage correction may not be fast enough for electronic loads which in turn can damage them. That is to device an automatic voltage stabilizer for a room size (max 200Watt) refrigerator using thyristor (SCRs), that will work for input range of 170 to 270V and stabilize the output at rated voltage and frequency. This system also provide short circuit protection and is smaller in size, no noise or wear issues in it. It provide better response time with inherent fast switching speed of SCRs of almost 20 KHz. A display is provided for input voltage, output voltage and fault type (if occur) information
